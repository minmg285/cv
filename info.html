        <p>I'm a dropout of Queen's University Belfast, UK. I've been a straight 'A's student 
                during my college days but I realized that getting high grades made me to have useless ego. 
                I left at the time before registerring into second year. I came back home and search everything 
                which seems to be excited. Then, I found coding and tech industry which is changing dramatically. 
                I dived into that and tried tolearn to code. At first, I started with free courses. But, 
                I found out that enrolling Angela Yu's course would be a worth try and fell in love with the way she taught programming. 
                Now I became a tech enthusiast who loves to code especially with javascript. My hobby is watching animes, japanese dramas and exploring japanese culture.
                I'm not pretty fluent in japanese but I'm trying to getting better at it. I found a software company with my friend, Hector. Making websites and apps for local companies in Myanmar, a country I lived
                My another hobby is watching dota2 matches and analyzing it. My level is not at par with pros so far, but I'm still learning it. I wrote many articles, and contents about dota2 in Chakchin Esports.
